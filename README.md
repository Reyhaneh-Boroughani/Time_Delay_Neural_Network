# Time_Delay_Neural_Network
Time delay neural network (TDNN) is a multilayer artificial neural network architecture whose purpose is to 1) classify patterns with shift-invariance, and 2) model context at each layer of the network.

This code creates and trains a Time Delay Neural Networks (timedelaynet) using different values of the hyper-parameters (the model selection on validation set is included in the code) for next step prediction of a given sequence.
